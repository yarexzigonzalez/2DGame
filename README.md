# 2D Platformer Game (JavaFX)

This is a simple one-level 2D platformer game built using **JavaFX**. 
It was our very first GUI-based game project — built with ambition, panic, and lots of `System.out.println()` debugging.

## Features
- Single level with platforming logic
- Character movement (left, right, jump)
- Collision detection
- JavaFX GUI with visuals drawn by **Ashley Hecker** (teammate)

## Requirements
- Java 23 or higher
- JavaFX SDK 24+

## How to Run

1. [Download the `.jar` file](https://github.com/yarexzigonzalez/2DGame/raw/main/game-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar)
2. Place the `.jar` file in a folder, e.g., `gameproject`
3. Open your terminal and navigate to the folder:
   ```bash
   cd C:\Users\example\Downloads\gameproject
4. Run the game using: 
   (Make sure the JavaFX SDK path is accurate and points to the lib folder) ```
   java --module-path "C:\Users\example\Downloads\openjfx-24.0.1_windows-x64_bin-sdk\javafx-sdk-24.0.1\lib" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml -jar game-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar```

## Project Info

This project was developed as part of **CS 142 – Advanced Programming with Java**.  
It was a group assignment, and I served as the **lead developer**, handling the full implementation of:
- Game logic
- JavaFX GUI structure
- Character movement
- Game mechanics
Our original project scope was more ambitious, but we learned to scale it down due to time and complexity — a key lesson.
